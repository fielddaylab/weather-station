{@Rae} Mission Control, this is Otter three, We just touched down at Mount Rea Station. Sky’s clear as a bell, temperature clocking in at -15 degrees Fahrenheit. Perfect daytime conditions. $[rae_mission_control]
{@Alex} Sure, perfect. If you’re a penguin. $[alex_sure_perfect]
{@Alex} Station's a little beat up. Not too bad, considering how long we've been away.  But it looks like there's no power. $[alex_stations_a]
{@Rae} We don't have time to mess around.  We've only got two hours of clear weather before I need to take off. You guys better boot up Argo. $[rae_we_dont]
{@Alex} Do you see Argo on the tower? Press the red button to boot him up. $[alex_alright_matt]
